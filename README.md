# js-interview-test
A JavaScript problem to solve before interviews.

# TO SETUP
- Clone the repo.
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Open `js/test.js` and `js/answer.js` in your favorite editor.
- Add your code to the `generateTree` function in `answer.js`.

# SOLVING THE TEST
- The test uses two JavaScript classes `Person` and `PersonTreeNode`.
- The `generateTree` function recieves a list of `Person` objects and should return the root PersonTreeNode (the ceo).
- Each `PersonTreeNode`'s `directReports` array should contain a `PersonTreeNode` for each direct report.
- Refresh the page or click the button to retry the test.
